# Azure
Datero usage in Microsoft Azure is convenient and smooth. 
Since it's a containerized application, you can run it on VM instance, Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
These are "installation" services for the Datero.

Apart of this you can use various Azure services as data sources for Datero.
The most traditional one is relational database represented by Azure Database service and Azure SQL managed instance.

# Clouds
Datero is a containerized application.
This means that you can use it in any environment where you can run containers.
This includes cloud environments like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

!!! info "Work in progress"
    Documentation for cloud environments is in progress. 
    It will be extended with the time.
    If you don't see a guide for your cloud environment, it doesn't mean that Datero can't be used there.
    It's just not documented yet.

## Individual guides
- [GCP](./gcp/index.md)
- [AWS](./aws/index.md)

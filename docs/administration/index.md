# Administration Guide
This part of the documentation is dedicated to more in-depth topics of the Datero data platform.
There is no need to have a dedicated administrator role for Datero.
In its minimal setup, Datero is just a single all-inclusive container.
It can be run easily by any developer or data analyst.

However, if you want to run Datero in a more complex environment, like a cloud, you will need to know more about the platform.
